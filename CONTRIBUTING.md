## Get Started

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Mai` for local development.

1. Clone your fork locally

```sh
    git clone https://github.com/xFGhoul/Mai.git
```

2. Ensure [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is installed.

```sh
    poetry shell
```

```sh
    poetry install
```

3. Create a branch for local development:

```sh
    git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

4. When you're done making changes, make sure to format your changes with `black`

```

5. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:
