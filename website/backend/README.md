# Mai Dashboard Backend

## PLEASE NOTE

As of right now, `fastapi-mail` and `fastapi-discord` have conflicting version solving with poetry due to fastapi requiremnets (`fastapi-mail` needs `0.70.0` but `fastapi-discord` needs `0.68.0`) so please use `requirements.txt` to install:

```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Follow The [Building The Dashboard](https://github.com/xFGhoul/Mai/blob/dev/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-the-dashboard) Tutorial.
